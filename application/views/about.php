Our mandate is to expand the Kingdom of God, spreading rays of hope in the hearts of the poor and the forsaken, kindling courage in the hearts of the despondent, and lighting a new strength in the hearts of those who think they are failures. We seek to spread the goodnews of our Lord Jesus Christ, working together with a network of churches and ministers to organise Spirit filled Worship, Miracle and Healing meeetings and crusades for the growth and nurturing of the body of Christ, leading them to experience the fullness of the Holy Spirit in their lives and training and equipping men and women in the Word of God to be effective leaders who, with godly character and in the power of the Holy Spirit, will transform nations for the glory of God.
